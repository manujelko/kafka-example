Absolutely, I'll explain the changes made and the reasons behind them:

### Original Configuration Issue

Initially, your Kafka broker was configured to use `localhost:9092` for both internal (within Docker) and external (from your host machine) communication. This setup works fine if Kafka is running directly on your host machine but gets complicated when Kafka is inside a Docker container. 

In Docker, `localhost` inside a container refers to the container itself, not the host machine. So, when your Python scripts (running on the host) tried to connect to `localhost:9092`, they were actually trying to connect to something on your host machine, not inside the Docker container.

### The Solution: Different Ports for Internal and External Access

To resolve this, we set up Kafka with two different listeners: one for internal Docker communication and one for external access from the host machine. This required using two different ports.

1. **Internal Listener (`PLAINTEXT`)**: 
   - Set to `kafka:9092`.
   - Used for communication within the Docker network (`kafka-network`). 
   - This address is used by services running in Docker (like AKHQ) that need to connect to Kafka.

2. **External Listener (`PLAINTEXT_HOST`)**:
   - Set to `0.0.0.0:9093` in the `KAFKA_LISTENERS` setting and advertised as `localhost:9093` in `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS`.
   - This listener allows your host machine (outside Docker) to connect to Kafka.
   - `0.0.0.0:9093` means the Kafka broker listens on all network interfaces of the container, allowing external connections.
   - The Docker `-p 9093:9093` port mapping makes this port accessible from your host machine at `localhost:9093`.
   - This address is used by your Python scripts or any other external client that needs to connect to Kafka.

### Makefile Changes

We updated the `make kafka` command in your Makefile to reflect these changes:

- `KAFKA_LISTENERS` includes both `PLAINTEXT` (for Docker internal) and `PLAINTEXT_HOST` (for external access).
- `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` advertises these listeners correctly.
- Docker port mapping `-p 9093:9093` to expose the external Kafka listener port to the host.

### Configuration Alignment

All parts of your setup need to be aligned with these settings:

- Services within Docker (like AKHQ) use `kafka:9092` for Kafka communication.
- External clients (like your Python scripts running on the host) use `localhost:9093`.

### Outcome

This configuration ensures that both internal services within Docker and external applications on your host can communicate with Kafka without any port conflicts or network issues, making your development and testing process smoother.
